# 📊 Unemployment Analysis with Python
This project is part of my internship with **Code Alpha**, where I conducted an exploratory data analysis of India's unemployment trends using Python.  
The focus was on understanding regional unemployment patterns, seasonal trends, and the impact of **COVID-19** on employment rates.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from the **CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy)**, available via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india), and contains monthly data up to November 2020.  
The columns include:
- `Region` (State)
- `Date`
- `Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)`
- `Estimated Employed`
- `Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)`

## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze unemployment trends across different Indian regions
- Investigate the **impact of COVID-19** on unemployment
- Identify **seasonal patterns** or trends over months
- Visualize the findings with clear and informative charts

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- 📈 **Unemployment rate trend over time by region**
- 📉 **Average unemployment rate per region**
- 🦠 **COVID-19 spike analysis (2020-focused)**
- 📆 **Seasonal monthly trends**
- 🔥 **Correlation heatmap** for numerical features

## 📌 Key Insights

- **COVID-19 lockdowns led to a massive unemployment spike** between April–June 2020.
- Regions like **Tripura and Haryana** reported consistently higher rates.
- Seasonal trends indicate slight rises in unemployment during mid-year months.
- Labour Participation Rate appears correlated with overall employment stability.
